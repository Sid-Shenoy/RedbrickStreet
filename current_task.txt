Current task: Setup Redbrick Street Houses

Modeling houses

- Now that each house in `houses.json` contains area bounds, we want to model all these houses.
- A `model` attribute will be used for each house in `houses.json` to accomplish this.
- This will contain all geometric data for the empty house (without any objects - like someone just moved out), representing rooms, doors, windows, and stairs.
- Data for the plot, first floor, and second floor must be stored.
- Outdoor data will be represented too (e.g. stairs, walkway, etc.).
- In this step, we won't worry about house objects yet - only shape.
- All rooms must be well-defined, as later on, this data will be used to add objects (e.g. fridge, bed, etc.)

As manually creating each house model will take up a lot of time and space, we will use code to accomplish this.

A house model should store data for 3 layers:
1) The plot (includes backyard, frontyard, driveway, stairs leading up to house, etc.)
2) The first floor (all walls, rooms, and staircase)
3) The second floor (everything in first floor except staircase)

Later on, objects will be added to each house (e.g. bed, TV, etc.) meaning that modification will eventually be required.

We want a function that given a house object like this, will generate data for a house:

```
  {
    "houseNumber": 0,
    "surname": "Whitlock",
    "occupants": [
      1,
      2,
      3,
      4
    ],
    "bounds": {
      "x": 0,
      "z": 0,
      "xsize": 30,
      "zsize": 12
    }
  }
```
