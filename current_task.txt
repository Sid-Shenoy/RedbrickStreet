Current task: Setup Redbrick Street Houses

1) Zoning (2D step)

- We first want to store all house-related zoning data before we start doing anything in 3D.
- Note that Redbrick Street will measure 200 m by length and 70 m by width in its entirety.
- One side will have the 15 even-numbered houses in order, and the other side will have the 15 odd-numbered houses in order
- House zones must all be 30 m in width and of roughly equal length (varied randomly, but lengths must sum to 200 m on each side) 
- The road in between will measure 200 m by length and 10 m by width
- Each house will have a backyard, a frontyard with two sides divided by sidewalk, a front garden, and a garage door - a zone represents the rectangular area containing all of these.
- Backyards will be separated by a fence
- The street will be surrounded by setup large brick walls on all 4 sides
- On each side, zones must be touching each other but not overlapping - when one ends, another begins
- In `houses.json`, each house should have a `bounds` attribute storing position (`x` and `z`) and dimensions (`xsize` and `zsize`) as attributes - houses will later be modelled relative to this.

2) Modeling houses

- Now that each house in `houses.json` contains area bounds, we want to model all these houses.
- A `model` attribute will be used for each house in `houses.json` to accomplish this.
- This will contain all geometric data for the empty house (without any objects - like someone just moved out), representing rooms, doors, windows, and stairs.
- Data for the plot, first floor, and second floor must be stored.
- Outdoor data will be represented too (e.g. stairs, walkway, etc.).
- In this step, we won't worry about house objects yet - only shape.
- All rooms must be well-defined, as later on, this data will be used to add objects (e.g. fridge, bed, etc.)

As manually creating each house will take up a lot of time and space, we will write a detailed prompt file with a spec, use ChatGPT to generate houses one by one, and hard code them into `houses.json`.

A house model should store data for 3 layers:
1) The plot (includes backyard, frontyard, driveway, stairs leading up to house, etc.)
2) The first floor (all walls, rooms, and staircase)
3) The second floor (everything in first floor except staircase)

Later on, objects will be added to each house (e.g. bed, TV, etc.) meaning that modification will eventually be required.

Write a highly specific specification (`house-generation-prompt.txt`) that given a house object like this, will generate data for a house:

```
  {
    "houseNumber": 0,
    "surname": "Whitlock",
    "occupants": [
      1,
      2,
      3,
      4
    ],
    "bounds": {
      "x": 0,
      "z": 0,
      "xsize": 30,
      "zsize": 12
    }
  }
```

The prompt must be highly specific, as all 30 houses will be parsed and initialized using the same parser - running the prompt 30 times should generate 30 such houses.
