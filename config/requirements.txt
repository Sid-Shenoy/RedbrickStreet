Summary of this directory:

Store an initial list of NPCs and houses with all relevant associations, plus 2D zoning data (bounds) for each house.

Non-functional requirements for this directory:

1) General requirements
1.1) Use files to store a list of NPCs and houses with all relevant relationships
1.2) All stored data must be stored in a way that is both human-readable and machine-readable
1.3) Data must be stored in a space-efficient manner, as long as readability is not compromised
1.4) Character encoding and allowed characters
1.4.1) All config files must be encoded as UTF-8
1.4.2) If apostrophes/quotes are used, they must be ASCII ' and " only

2) Data storage requirements
2.1) There must be 70 to 80 NPCs plus the player, and 30 houses in all
2.2) Each NPC must have:
2.2.1) An integer ID (primary key)
2.2.2) Full name (first and last) with no special characters (e.g. accented letters)
2.2.3) Gender (must be either "M" or "F")
2.2.4) Age (must be an integer)
2.2.4.1) An NPC with an age or 17 or below must be living with an adult family member
2.2.4.2) An NPC cannot have an age less than or equal to 5
2.2.5) Accent language (must belong to enum { Canadian, SouthAsian, Chinese, African, MiddleEastern })
2.2.6) Career (name of current job position - can also be "Student", "Unemployed", or "Retired")
2.2.7) Religion (must be a single word)
2.2.8) Family information (choose best way to store this info)
2.2.8.1) Stored relationships are limited to marriage, parent/child, and siblings
2.2.8.2) A marriage must be between one man and one woman
2.2.8.3) Neither a man nor a woman can have multiple husbands/wives
2.2.8.4) An NPC must have an age of 18 or above to be married
2.2.8.5) An NPC must have an age of 18 or above to have children
2.2.8.6) A parent must be at least 18 years older than their child
2.2.9) Personality traits (list of 3 personality adjectives)

2.2.11) 5 facts about the NPC, stated in first person
2.2.12) Social media information
2.2.12.1) Handle (exclusing the "@")
2.2.12.2) Bio (like an actual Instagram bio - lots of variation expected among NPCs - should look human)
2.2.12.3) Followers count (a number - just avoid too many round numbers as it should be like reality)
2.2.12.4) Following count (similar idea to above)
2.3) Each house must have:
2.3.1) A house number (primary key) from 0 to 29
2.3.2) An associated surname (for all house occupants)
2.3.2.1) This field is not defined for house 7
2.3.3) List of occupants
2.3.4) A minimum of 1 resident and a hard maximum of 6 residents
2.3.5) Zoning bounds (2D)
2.3.5.1) Each house must include a `bounds` object (a single rectangle covering the full property footprint)
2.3.5.2) This object must store numeric attributes `x`, `z`, `xsize`, and `zsize`
2.3.5.2.1) x in [0, 70]
2.3.5.2.2) z in [0, 200]
2.3.5.2.3) xsize = 30, zsize is integer in [10, 16]
2.3.5.2.4) x + xsize <= 70
2.3.5.2.5) z + zsize <= 200
2.3.6) Street geometry constraints (global zoning rules)
2.3.6.3) House zones must all be 30 m wide:
2.3.6.3.1) even-numbered houses must be on one side: x = 0, xsize = 30
2.3.6.3.2) odd-numbered houses must be on the other side: x = 40, xsize = 30
2.3.6.4) Along the street length (z axis), houses must be contiguous and non-overlapping on each side:
2.3.6.4.1) Even side contains houses [0,2,4,...,28] in increasing order of houseNumber along +z
2.3.6.4.2) Odd side contains houses [1,3,5,...,29] in increasing order of houseNumber along +z
2.3.6.4.3) On each side, when one house zone ends, the next begins (no gaps, no overlaps)
2.3.6.5) The 15 house z-lengths (zsize) on each side must sum to exactly 200 m
2.4) The house with a number of 7 will only be occupied by the player (ID = 0)
2.4.1) The player will not be included in the list of NPCs, but referenced by id as an occupant of house 7
2.5) No two residents living in different houses can share a surname (player surname doesn't matter)
2.6) No two NPCs may share the same first name
2.7) No two NPCs may share the same social media handle
2.8) Every NPC must live in exactly one house
2.9) All NPCs in the same house must be related

3) Information requirements:
3.1) Avoid recurring themes across many NPCs (like similar careers, interests, facts, and social media info)
3.2) The cultural voice of an NPC should somewhat correspond to their accent language
3.3) No NPC should be aggressive or unfriendly
3.3.1) No NPC should have any data that indicates passive aggressiveness
3.4) House lengths should be roughly equal with some variance.
