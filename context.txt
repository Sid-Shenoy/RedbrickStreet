I have sent you:
1) A list of all project files
2) The contents of several important project files

To limit prompt size, some large files have not been displayed. Only if there exists a `requirements.txt` that sufficiently documents a file, that file will be included in `exclude_list.txt` meaning its contents have not been printed here.
