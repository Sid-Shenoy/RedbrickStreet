1) HUD module (`hud.ts`)

1.1) Intent

1.1.1) Provide a bottom-left on-screen HUD overlay:
1.1.1.1) a minimap showing plot surfaces and the road (with distinct colors)
1.1.1.2) a health bar with a continuous green->red gradient as health decreases
1.1.1.3) a stamina bar in blue that darkens as stamina lowers and darkens slightly while sprinting
1.1.1.4) numeric values beside both bars (value/max)

1.2) Exported function

1.2.1) Export: `createHud(scene, camera, houses) -> hudApi`
1.2.2) `houses` must be `HouseWithModel[]` and the minimap must be derived from:
1.2.2.1) `house.model.plot.regions` for plot surfaces
1.2.2.2) a global road rectangle at x in [0, 230], z in [30, 40]
1.2.3) The HUD must attach DOM elements to `document.body`.
1.2.4) The HUD overlay must use `pointer-events: none` so it does not block pointer lock / canvas clicks.

1.3) Minimap behavior (hard)

1.3.1) The minimap must show a 10m x 6m area centered on the player.
1.3.2) The minimap must rotate to reflect player orientation so that "forward" is always up.
1.3.3) The minimap must draw a centered triangular arrow representing the player:
1.3.3.1) the arrow must always point "forward"/up on the minimap.

1.4) Stamina behavior (hard)

1.4.1) Sprint input must be Shift (ShiftLeft or ShiftRight).
1.4.2) When sprinting and moving, stamina must decrease continuously.
1.4.3) When not sprinting, stamina must replenish gradually.
1.4.4) Sprinting must increase `camera.speed` while stamina remains above 0.
