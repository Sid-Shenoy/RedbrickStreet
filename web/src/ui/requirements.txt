1) HUD module (`hud.ts`)

1.1) Intent

1.1.1) Provide a bottom-left on-screen HUD overlay:
1.1.1.1) a minimap showing plot surfaces and the road (with distinct colors)
1.1.1.2) a health bar with a continuous green->red gradient as health decreases
1.1.1.3) a stamina bar in blue that darkens as stamina lowers and darkens slightly while sprinting
1.1.1.4) numeric values beside both bars (value/max)

1.2) Exported function

1.2.1) Export: `createHud(scene, camera, houses) -> hudApi`
1.2.2) `houses` must be `HouseWithModel[]` and the minimap must be derived from:
1.2.2.1) `house.model.plot.regions` for plot surfaces
1.2.2.2) a global road rectangle at x in [0, 230], z in [30, 40]
1.2.3) The HUD must attach DOM elements to `document.body`.
1.2.4) The HUD overlay must use `pointer-events: none` so it does not block pointer lock / canvas clicks.

1.3) Minimap behavior (hard)

1.3.1) The minimap must show a 40m x 24m area centered on the player.
1.3.2) The minimap must rotate to reflect player orientation so that "forward" is always up.
1.3.3) The minimap must draw a centered triangular arrow representing the player:
1.3.3.1) the arrow must always point "forward"/up on the minimap.

1.3.4) The minimap must draw a small "house" icon at the player's spawn point.
1.3.4.1) The spawn point must be captured once when `createHud` is called (world XZ).
1.3.4.2) The icon must be drawn in minimap screen-space so it stays upright (does not rotate with the minimap), but its position must be computed from world coordinates under the minimap transform.
1.3.4.3) If the spawn point lies outside the visible minimap area, the icon must be clamped to the minimap edge (with minimal padding), preserving the direction from the player.
1.3.4.4) When the spawn/home icon is clamped (off-map), it must be filled with grey.
1.3.4.5) The spawn/home icon must always be visible.

1.4) Stamina behavior (hard)

1.4.1) Sprint input must be Shift (ShiftLeft or ShiftRight).
1.4.2) When sprinting and moving, stamina must decrease continuously.
1.4.3) When not sprinting, stamina must replenish gradually.
1.4.4) Sprinting must increase `camera.speed` while stamina remains above 0.

2) Weapon UI module (`weaponUi.ts`)

2.1) Intent

2.1.1) Provide:
2.1.1.1) A Tab-activated weapon wheel (4 options):
2.1.1.1.1) Unarmed
2.1.1.1.2) SmokeShot
2.1.1.1.3) SprayShot
2.1.1.1.4) BlastShot
2.1.1.2) Number-key weapon switching (works whether wheel is visible or not)
2.1.1.3) A bottom-right weapon-in-hand image when armed
2.1.1.4) A weapon icon shown above the HUD (icons must be aspect-ratio-safe)
2.1.1.5) Click/hold shooting with a rapid 5-frame animation sequence and `gunshot.mp3`

2.2) Exported function

2.2.1) Export: `createWeaponUi(scene, canvas, weapons) -> weaponUiApi`
2.2.2) Inputs:
2.2.2.1) `scene` is used for lifecycle cleanup via `scene.onDisposeObservable`
2.2.2.2) `canvas` is the Babylon render canvas
2.2.2.3) `weapons` is loaded from `/config/weapons.json` and must follow `WeaponConfig` in `types/config.ts`

2.3) Weapon wheel behavior (hard)

2.3.1) Pressing Tab must toggle the weapon wheel visibility.
2.3.2) While visible:
2.3.2.1) the wheel must display exactly 4 options (Unarmed + 3 weapons)
2.3.2.2) clicking a segment must equip that option and close the wheel
2.3.2.3) pressing keys 1–4 must equip and close the wheel
2.3.3) Tab default browser behavior must be prevented.

2.4) Number-key equipping (hard)

2.4.1) Key 1 must equip Unarmed.
2.4.2) Keys must equip weapons based on `weapons.json`:
2.4.2.1) `toEquip` determines which number equips each weapon.
2.4.3) Number-key equipping must work whether or not the wheel is visible.

2.4.4) Reload sound on weapon equip (hard)
2.4.4.1) When switching to a weapon (SmokeShot / SprayShot / BlastShot), play `/assets/audio/sfx/reload.mp3` once.
2.4.4.2) This must trigger whether the switch happens via number keys or via weapon wheel.
2.4.4.3) This must NOT play when switching to Unarmed.

2.5) Weapon visuals (hard)

2.5.1) When Unarmed:
2.5.1.1) no weapon-in-hand image is shown
2.5.1.2) shooting is disabled
2.5.1.3) the weapon icon above the HUD must display "🚫"
2.5.2) When a weapon is equipped:
2.5.2.1) show the corresponding `grip.png` at the bottom-right
2.5.2.2) the weapon-in-hand image height must be exactly `${weapon.handHeightVh}vh`
2.5.2.2.1) Allowed values are 64 and 80
2.5.2.2.2) Only BlastShot should use 80; all other weapons must use 64
2.5.2.3) show the weapon `icon.png` above the HUD
2.5.2.3.1) icons must be displayed with `object-fit: contain` to handle varying aspect ratios
2.5.2.4) show the correct crosshair from:
2.5.2.4.1) `/assets/weapons/crosshairs/small.svg`
2.5.2.4.2) `/assets/weapons/crosshairs/large.svg`
2.5.2.4.3) chosen by `weapon.crosshair`

2.6) Shooting (hard)

2.6.1) When a weapon is equipped, holding left mouse must fire repeatedly at `weapon.fireRate` shots/second.
2.6.2) Each shot must animate frames in this exact order:
2.6.2.1) grip -> pull -> fire -> pull -> grip
2.6.3) Each shot must play `/assets/audio/sfx/gunshot.mp3`.
2.6.4) Playback volume must be `weapon.shotVolume / 100` (clamped to [0,1]).
