1) House modeling constraints

1.1) When loaded (from `web/public/config/houses.json`), all houses must store all geometric data for the empty house
1.1.1) This should be done through a seeded house model generation function
1.1.1.1) The house models should be the same each time the game is loaded
1.1.2) Right now, they will not include objects (e.g. chairs, tables, etc.) - it should be empty like the owners just moved out
1.2.2) All coordinates are lot local
1.2.2.1) For even-numbered houses, (x+px, z+pz) in street coordinates becomes (0+px, 0+pz) in lot-local coordinates
1.2.2.2) For odd-numbered houses, (x+xsize+px, z+zsize+pz) in street coordinates becomes (0-px, 0-pz) in lot-local coordinates
1.2) Modeling data will represent rooms/areas (regions), and house construction items (walls, doors, windows, stairs, etc.)
1.3) Data for the entire plot, first floor, and second floor must be stored
1.4) The plot must contain a backyard area, a house area, a frontyard area, and a sidewalk
1.4.1) All regions must be defined as rectangles or polygons
1.4.2) The sidewalk must be 1.5 m wide and must sit 3.5 m away from the road edge (measured from the sidewalk edge closest to the road)
1.4.2.1) In lot-local coordinates, the sidewalk is always a rectangle from (0, 25) to (xsize, 26.5)
1.4.3) No regions may overlap, and all regions together must cover the entire plot
1.5) Each region must have the following fields:
1.5.1) A name which will be used for readability and identification of regions
1.5.2) A surface (must belong to enum { black, grass, concrete_light, concrete_medium, concrete_dark })
1.5.3) Shape type (must be either "polygon" or "rectangle")
1.5.4) Shape coordinates
1.5.4.1) [[min_x, min_z], [max_x, max_z]] for rectangle
1.5.4.2) [[p1_x, p1_z], [p2_x, p2_z], ... [pn_x, pn_z]] for polygon from points (p1, p2, ... pn, p1)

Example of an original house object from `web/public/config/houses.json`:
```
  {
    "houseNumber": 0,
    "surname": "Whitlock",
    "occupants": [1, 2, 3, 4],
    "bounds": {
      "x": 0,
      "z": 0,
      "xsize": 12,
      "zsize": 30
    }
  }
```

Example of a house object after being loaded and updated (modelled after 43 Jenmat Dr.):
```
