1) All coordinates are lot local (`lotTransform.ts`)

1.2.1) Lot-local coordinates are always within the lot rectangle (localX in [0, xsize], localZ in [0, zsize])
1.2.2) The lot-local "front" edge is always localZ = zsize (30), regardless of street side
1.2.2.1) Converting lot-local (localX, localZ) to world/street coordinates:
1.2.2.1.1) Even-numbered houses: worldX = x + localX, worldZ = z + localZ
1.2.2.1.2) Odd-numbered houses: worldX = x + (xsize - localX), worldZ = z + (zsize - localZ)

2) House modeling constraints (`generateHouseModel.ts`)

2.1) When loaded (from `web/public/config/houses.json`), all houses must store all geometric data for the house
2.1.1) This should be done through a seeded house model generation function
2.1.1.1) The house models should be the same each time the game is loaded
2.1.2) Data for the entire plot, first floor, and second floor must be stored
2.1.3) Right now, they will not include objects (e.g. chairs, tables, etc.) - it should be empty like the owners just moved out

2.2) Modeling data will contain the following:
2.2.1) Regions (representing rooms/areas in 2d)
2.2.1.1) All regions must be defined as rectangles or polygons
2.2.2) Construction (representing house construction items like walls, doors, windows, stairs, etc.)
2.2.3) Objects (representing movable objects like tables, chairs, appliances, etc.)

2.3) Each region must have the following fields:
2.3.1) A name which will be used for readability and identification of regions
2.3.2) A surface type (will be used to determine texture)
2.3.2.1) Must belong to enum { black, grass, concrete_light, concrete_medium, concrete_dark, wood, tile })
2.3.3) Shape type (must be either "polygon" or "rectangle")
2.3.4) Shape coordinates
2.3.4.1) [[min_x, min_z], [max_x, max_z]] for rectangle
2.3.4.2) [[p1_x, p1_z], [p2_x, p2_z], ... [pn_x, pn_z]] for polygon from points (p1, p2, ... pn, p1)
2.3.4.3) All coordinates must be in lot-local space

2.4) Plot specifications (`plot.ts`):
2.4.1) No regions may overlap, and all regions together must cover the entire plot
2.4.2) The plot must contain exactly one region each for:
2.4.2.1) `backyard` behind house (away from road)
2.4.2.2) `houseregion` as the flat house region surface where the house goes
2.4.2.3) `frontlawn_near` as the section of the front lawn closer to the house
2.4.2.4) `frontlawn_far` as the section of the front lawn farther from the house and closer to the road
2.4.2.5) `driveway_near` as the section of the driveway closer to the house
2.4.2.6) `driveway_far` as the section of the driveway farther from the house and closer to the road
2.4.2.7) `sidewalk` as the sidewalk separating `driveway_near` and `driveway_far`, as well as `frontlawn_near` and `frontlawn_far`
2.4.2.7.1) Must be 1.5 m wide and must sit 3.5 m away from the road edge (measured from the sidewalk edge closest to the road)
2.4.2.7.2) In lot-local coordinates, the sidewalk is always a rectangle from (0, 25) to (xsize, 26.5)
2.4.2.8) `walkway` as the path leading up to the house entrance

2.5) First floor specifications (`firstFloor.ts`):
2.5.1) No regions may overlap, and all regions together must cover the entire house region from the plot
2.5.2) The first floor must contain exactly one region each for:
2.5.2.1) `foyer` as the interior entry area immediately inside the front door
2.5.2.1.1) Must be connected to `walkway` from the plot
2.5.2.2) `garage` as the indoor garage area
2.5.2.2.1) Must be connected to `driveway_near` from the plot
2.5.2.3) `livingroom` as the primary living / sitting area on the first floor
2.5.2.3.1) Must be connected to `foyer`
2.5.2.4) `kitchen` as the kitchen area (where counters/appliances will later be placed)
2.5.2.5) `dining` as the primary dining area on the first floor
2.5.2.5.1) Must be connected to `kitchen`
2.5.2.6) `bathroom_small` as a half-bathroom (toilet + sink) on the first floor
2.5.2.7) `stairs` as the staircase footprint region (the area occupied by the stairs on the first floor)
2.5.2.7.1) Must be a rectangle
2.5.2.8) `hallway` as the circulation space connecting `foyer` to the other first-floor rooms and to `stairs`
2.5.3) The first floor must contain a minimum of 2 and no more than 3 distinct optional regions:
2.5.3.1) Optional region names: `mudroom`, `laundry`, `pantry`, `office`, `utility`

2.6) Second floor specifications (`secondFloor.ts`):
2.6.1) No regions may overlap, and all regions together must cover the entire house region from the plot
2.6.2) The second floor must contain an appropriate number of distinct `bedroom` regions
2.6.2.1) Minimum of ceil((number of occupants) / 2) and no more than min(3, ceil((number of occupants) / 2) + 1)
2.6.3) The second floor must contain exactly one region each for:
2.6.3.1) `office` as the primary work room
2.6.3.2) `bathroom_large` as the primary full bathroom on the second floor (toilet + sink + bath/shower)
2.6.3.3) `stairwell` as the upstairs landing / opening associated with the staircase
2.6.3.3.1) Must overlap and be congruent with the first floor `stairs` region
2.6.3.4) `hallway` as the circulation space connecting other rooms to `stairwell`
2.6.3.5) `laundry` as the laundry room
2.5.3.6) `bathroom_small` as a half-bathroom (toilet + sink) on the second floor
2.6.4) The second floor must contain a minimum of 1 and no more than 3 distinct `closet` regions

Example of an original house object from `web/public/config/houses.json`:
```
  {
    "houseNumber": 0,
    "surname": "Whitlock",
    "occupants": [1, 2, 3, 4],
    "bounds": {
      "x": 0,
