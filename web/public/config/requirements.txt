Summary of this directory:

- Store houses and zoning/modeling information regarding houses.
- Store weapon information.
- We do NOT store NPCs/characters. Only the original pre-takeover occupant count is required per house.

Non-functional requirements for this directory:

1) General requirements

1.1) All config files must be encoded as UTF-8
1.2) If apostrophes/quotes are used, they must be ASCII ' and " only
1.3) Data must be stored in a way that is both easily human-readable and machine-readable
1.4) Data must be stored in a space-efficient manner, as long as readability is not compromised

2) House requirements (`houses.json`)

2.1) `houses.json` must store only a top-level array of house objects
2.1.1) There must be 30 houses in all
2.1.2) The player's house must be included in the list of houses

2.2) Each house must have:
2.2.1) A house number (primary key) from 0 to 29
2.2.2) `occupantCount`: the original number of residents in the home before the zombie takeover
2.2.2.1) Must be an integer
2.2.2.2) Must be within [1, 5]
2.2.3) A bounds object (a single rectangle covering the full property footprint)
2.2.3.1) This object must store numeric attributes representing size and position relative to the street
2.2.3.2) From a bird's eye view, x represents offset from left, z represents offset from top
2.2.3.3) For all houses: xsize is integer in [14, 18], zsize = 30

2.3) Player home constraints

2.3.1) The house with a number of 7 is the player's home
2.3.2) House 7 must have `occupantCount` equal to 1

2.4) Zoning bounds (2D)

Redbrick Street Specifications:
```
- Redbrick Street measures 230 m (along x-axis) by 70 m (along z-axis)
- The road measures 230 m (along x-axis) by 10 m (along z-axis) from z=30 to z=40
```

2.5) Street geometry constraints (global zoning rules)

2.5.1) House zones must all be 30 m wide (along z-axis):
2.5.1.1) Even-numbered houses must be on one side: z = 0, zsize = 30
2.5.1.2) Odd-numbered houses must be on the other side: z = 40, zsize = 30
2.5.2) Along the street length (x-axis), houses must be contiguous and non-overlapping on each side:
2.5.2.1) Even side contains houses [0,2,4,...,28] in increasing order of houseNumber along +x
2.5.2.2) Odd side contains houses [1,3,5,...,29] in increasing order of houseNumber along +x
2.5.2.3) On each side, when one house zone ends, the next begins (no gaps, no overlaps)
2.5.3) The 15 house x-lengths (x-size) on each side must sum to exactly 230 m
2.5.3.1) House x-lengths (x-size) should be roughly equal with some variance
2.5.3.2) House x-lengths (x-size) do not need to be symmetrical across both sides of the street

Example of a house object from `houses.json`:
```
{
  "houseNumber": 0,
  "occupantCount": 4,
  "bounds": {
    "x": 0,
    "z": 0,
    "xsize": 12,
    "zsize": 30
  }
}
```

3) Weapon requirements (`weapons.json`)

3.1) `weapons.json` must store only a top-level array of weapon objects

3.2) Each weapon must have:
3.2.1) A unique numeric id (must start from 0)
3.2.2) A name (string)
3.2.3) Which number key to press to equip the weapon (1 is reserved for unarmed and should not be used)
3.2.4) A fire rate (shots per second)
3.2.4.1) Must be a number strictly greater than 0, with floating point values allowed
3.2.5) A shot volume from 0 to 100 inclusive (how loudly `gunshot.mp3` plays)
3.2.6) A damage amount per shot
3.2.7) A crosshair type (must be either "small" or "large")

Example of a weapon object from `weapons.json`:
```
{
  "id": 0,
  "name": "SmokeShot",
  "toEquip": 2,
  "fireRate": 3,
  "shotVolume": 50,
  "damage": 12,
  "crosshair": "small"
}
```
