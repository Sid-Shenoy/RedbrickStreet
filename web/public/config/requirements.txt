  "age": 38,
  "career": "Accessibility engineer",

  ],
  "interests": [
    "stargazing",
    "wood carving",
    "kite building"
  ],
  "about": [
    "I got into accessibility work because it feels like the most practical kind of empathy: make things usable, then make them better.",
    "I keep a cheap pair of binoculars by the back door and I step outside at night like I'm checking on the street, but I'm really checking on the sky.",
    "I like small crafts that require patience, like carving a spoon or sanding a piece until it finally feels right in your hand.",
    "I don't talk a lot in groups, but if you ask me a specific question, you'll get a real answer and probably a quiet joke attached to it.",
    "I want the street to feel steady and normal, like the kind of place where problems stay small because people notice each other."
  ],
  "socialMedia": {
    "handle": "dorian_w78",
    "bio": "accessibility work • small crafts • stars when the street is quiet • TO",

    "following": 372
  }
}
```

3) House requirements (`houses.json`)

3.1) `houses.json` must store only a top-level array of house objects
3.1.1) There must be 30 houses in all
3.1.2) The player's house must be included in the list of houses

3.2) Each house must have:
3.2.1) A house number (primary key) from 0 to 29
3.2.2) An associated surname (for all house occupants)
3.2.2.1) This field is not defined for house 7
3.2.3) A list of occupants (by NPC id, like a foreign key)
3.2.4) A minimum of 1 resident and a hard maximum of 5 residents

3.3) Player home constraints
3.3.1) The house with a number of 7 will only be occupied by the player (id = 0)
3.3.2) The player will be referenced by id as an occupant of house 7

3.4) Zoning bounds (2D)

Redbrick Street Specifications:
```
- Redbrick Street measures 200 m (along x-axis) by 70 m (along z-axis)
- The road measures 200 m (along x-axis) by 10 m (along z-axis) from z=30 to z=40
```

3.4.1) Each house must include a bounds object (a single rectangle covering the full property footprint)
3.4.2) This object must store numeric attributes representing size and position relative to the street
3.4.2.1) From a bird's eye view, x represents offset from left, z represents offset from top
3.4.2.2) For all houses, xsize is integer in [12, 16], zsize = 30

3.5) Street geometry constraints (global zoning rules)
3.5.1) House zones must all be 30 m wide (along z-axis):
3.5.1.1) Even-numbered houses must be on one side: z = 0, zsize = 30
3.5.1.2) Odd-numbered houses must be on the other side: z = 40, zsize = 30
3.5.2) Along the street length (x-axis), houses must be contiguous and non-overlapping on each side:
3.5.2.1) Even side contains houses [0,2,4,...,28] in increasing order of houseNumber along +x
3.5.2.2) Odd side contains houses [1,3,5,...,29] in increasing order of houseNumber along +x
3.5.2.3) On each side, when one house zone ends, the next begins (no gaps, no overlaps)
3.5.3) The 15 house x-lengths (x-size) on each side must sum to exactly 200 m
3.5.3.1) House x-lengths (x-size) should be roughly equal with some variance
3.5.3.2) House x-lengths (x-size) do not need to be symmetrical across both sides of the street

3.6) Cross-house and within-house constraints (cross-file with characters.json)
3.6.1) No two residents living in different houses can share a surname (player surname doesn't matter)
3.6.2) All NPCs in the same house must be related

Example of a house object from `houses.json`:
```
{
  "houseNumber": 0,
  "surname": "Whitlock",
  "occupants": [1, 2, 3, 4],
  "bounds": {
    "x": 0,
    "z": 0,
    "xsize": 12,
    "zsize": 30
  }
}
```
