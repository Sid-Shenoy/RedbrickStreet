```
    {
        "id": 1,
        "firstName": "Dorian",
        "lastName": "Whitlock",

                3,
                4
            ]
        },
        "personalityTraits": [
            "measured",
            "wry",
            "particular"
        ],
        "interests": [

            "kite building"
        ],
        "about": [
            "I got into accessibility work because it feels like the most practical kind of empathy: make things usable, then make them better.",
            "I keep a cheap pair of binoculars by the back door and I step outside at night like I'm checking on the street, but I'm really checking on the sky.",
            "I like small crafts that require patience, like carving a spoon or sanding a piece until it finally feels right in your hand.",
            "I don't talk a lot in groups, but if you ask me a specific question, you'll get a real answer and probably a quiet joke attached to it.",
            "I want the street to feel steady and normal, like the kind of place where problems stay small because people notice each other."
        ],
        "socialMedia": {
            "handle": "dorian_w78",
            "bio": "accessibility work • small crafts • stars when the street is quiet • TO",
            "followers": 436,
            "following": 372
        }
    }
```

3) House requirements (`houses.json`)

3.1) `houses.json` must store only a top-level array of house objects
3.1.1) There must be 30 houses in all
3.1.2) The player's house must be included in the list of houses

3.2) Each house must have:
3.2.1) A house number (primary key) from 0 to 29
3.2.2) An associated surname (for all house occupants)
3.2.2.1) This field is not defined for house 7
3.2.3) A list of occupants (by NPC id, like a foreign key)
3.2.4) A minimum of 1 resident and a hard maximum of 5 residents

3.3) Player home constraints
3.3.1) The house with a number of 7 will only be occupied by the player (id = 0)
3.3.2) The player will be referenced by id as an occupant of house 7

3.4) Zoning bounds (2D)

Redbrick Street Specifications:
```
- Redbrick Street measures 200 m (along x-axis) by 70 m (along z-axis)
- The road measures 200 m (along x-axis) by 10 m (along z-axis) from z=30 to z=40
```

3.4.1) Each house must include a bounds object (a single rectangle covering the full property footprint)
3.4.2) This object must store numeric attributes representing size and position relative to the street
3.4.2.1) From a bird's eye view, x represents offset from left, z represents offset from top
3.4.2.2) For all houses, xsize is integer in [10, 16], zsize = 30

3.5) Street geometry constraints (global zoning rules)
3.5.1) House zones must all be 30 m wide (along z-axis):
3.5.1.1) Even-numbered houses must be on one side: z = 0, zsize = 30
3.5.1.2) Odd-numbered houses must be on the other side: z = 40, zsize = 30
3.5.2) Along the street length (x-axis), houses must be contiguous and non-overlapping on each side:
3.5.2.1) Even side contains houses [0,2,4,...,28] in increasing order of houseNumber along +x
3.5.2.2) Odd side contains houses [1,3,5,...,29] in increasing order of houseNumber along +x
3.5.2.3) On each side, when one house zone ends, the next begins (no gaps, no overlaps)
3.5.3) The 15 house x-lengths (x-size) on each side must sum to exactly 200 m
3.5.3.1) House x-lengths (x-size) should be roughly equal with some variance
3.5.3.2) House x-lengths (x-size) do not need to be symmetrical across both sides of the street

3.6) Cross-house and within-house constraints (cross-file with characters.json)
3.6.1) No two residents living in different houses can share a surname (player surname doesn't matter)
3.6.2) All NPCs in the same house must be related

4) House modeling constraints

4.1) When loaded, all houses must store all geometric data for the empty house
4.1.1) This should be done through a seeded house model generation function
4.1.1.1) The house models should be the same each time the game is loaded
4.1.2) Right now, they will not include objects (e.g. chairs, tables, etc.) - it should be empty like the owners just moved out
4.2.2) All coordinates are lot local
4.2.2.1) For even-numbered houses, (x+px, z+pz) in street coordinates becomes (0+px, 0+pz) in lot-local coordinates
4.2.2.2) For odd-numbered houses, (x+xsize+px, z+zsize+pz) in street coordinates becomes (0-px, 0-pz) in lot-local coordinates
4.2) Modeling data will represent rooms/areas (regions), and house construction items (walls, doors, windows, stairs, etc.)
4.3) Data for the entire plot, first floor, and second floor must be stored
4.4) The plot must contain a backyard area, a house area, a frontyard area, and a sidewalk
4.4.1) All regions must be defined as rectangles or polygons
4.4.2) The sidewalk must be 1.5 m wide and must sit 3.5 m away from the road edge (measured from the sidewalk edge closest to the road)
4.4.2.1) In lot-local coordinates, the sidewalk is always a rectangle from (0, 25) to (xsize, 26.5)
4.4.3) No regions may overlap, and all regions together must cover the entire plot
4.5) Each region must have the following fields:
4.5.1) A name which will be used for readability and identification of regions
4.5.2) A surface (must belong to enum { black, grass, concrete_light, concrete_medium, concrete_dark })
4.5.3) Shape type (must be either "polygon" or "rectangle")
4.5.4) Shape coordinates
4.5.4.1) [[min_x, min_z], [max_x, max_z]] for rectangle
4.5.4.2) [[p1_x, p1_z], [p2_x, p2_z], ... [pn_x, pn_z]] for polygon from points (p1, p2, ... pn, p1)
